# Contributing to Cross-Chain DAO Treasury Automation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the first DAO treasury autopilot with cross-chain intelligence!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reactive-hackathon
   cd reactive-hackathon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your private keys and RPC URLs
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

## Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing contract patterns
- Include comprehensive tests for new features

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Test individual contract functions
- **Integration tests**: Test cross-contract interactions
- **Local demo**: Verify complete system functionality

```bash
npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests
npm run demo:local    # Full demo on local network
```

## Deployment

Before submitting changes:

1. Run health check: `npm run health-check`
2. Analyze gas usage: `npm run gas-analysis`
3. Test deployment: `npm run demo:local`
