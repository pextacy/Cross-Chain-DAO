Cross-Chain DAO Treasury Automation
	•	Concept:
A treasury tool that auto-rebalances DAO funds across chains based on market conditions.
	•	Example: ETH drops 10% → auto-sell to stablecoins. Market recovers → auto-buy back.
	•	Why it stands out:
	•	DAOs need autonomous, rules-based treasury management.
	•	Brings real-world DAO adoption → big traction potential.
	•	Every action is an on-chain event → heavy REACT gas use.
	•	Killer detail:
	•	Demo: Show a DAO vault automatically adjusting allocations across ETH + Arbitrum + BNB chain.
	•	Pitch line:
“The first DAO treasury autopilot with cross-chain intelligence.”
