# Security Policy

## Overview

Cross-Chain DAO Treasury Automation handles significant financial assets and requires the highest security standards. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Architecture

### Smart Contract Security

**Access Control**
- Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- Multi-signature governance requirements
- Emergency pause functionality
- Time-locked critical operations

**Financial Security**
- Minimum balance protections
- Rebalancing cooldown periods
- Maximum transaction limits
- Slippage protection on swaps

**Cross-Chain Security**
- Verified callback origins
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Gas limit controls
- Chain ID validation

### Reactive Network Integration

**Event Monitoring**
- Verified price feed sources
- Threshold validation
- Anomaly detection
- Circuit breakers for extreme conditions

**Callback Security**
- Authorized caller verification
- Payload validation
- Gas limit enforcement
- Failure handling

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Private Key Security**
   - Never share private keys
   - Use hardware wallets for mainnet
   - Store keys securely offline
   - Use different keys for testing

2. **Contract Interaction**
   - Verify contract addresses
   - Check transaction details
   - Use recommended gas limits
   - Monitor treasury balances

3. **Governance**
   - Participate in governance decisions
   - Review parameter changes
   - Monitor emergency actions
   - Report suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Development Environment**
   - Use separate keys for testing
   - Never commit keys to version control
   - Use environment variables
   - Regularly update dependencies

2. **Code Security**
   - Follow OpenZeppelin patterns
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Implement input validation

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Verify contract bytecode
   - Use deterministic builds
   - Test on testnets first
   - Document all parameters

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **Price Feed Dependency**
   - Relies on Chainlink oracle reliability
   - Single point of failure per asset
   - Potential for oracle manipulation

2. **MEV Exposure**
   - Rebalancing transactions visible in mempool
   - Potential for front-running
   - Slippage during volatile periods

3. **Cross-Chain Risks**
   - Bridge security dependencies
   - Network congestion impacts
   - Inconsistent block times

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Oracle Security**
   - Multiple price feed validation
   - Anomaly detection algorithms
   - Circuit breakers for extreme values
   - Manual override capabilities

2. **MEV Protection**
   - Private mempool submission
   - Batch transaction processing
   - Randomized execution timing
   - Slippage protection

3. **Cross-Chain Reliability**
   - Multiple bridge options
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Graceful degradation
   - Emergency local operations

## Reporting a Vulnerability
