# Cross-Chain DAO Treasury Automation Architecture

## Overview
"The first DAO treasury autopilot with cross-chain intelligence."

A fully autonomous treasury management system that monitors market conditions and automatically rebalances DAO funds across multiple chains based on predefined rules.

## Core Components

### 1. Origin Contracts (Price Feeds)
- **Chainlink Price Feeds** on Ethereum/Arbitrum/BSC
- **Uniswap V3 Pool Events** for DEX price monitoring
- **Custom Oracle Aggregator** for multiple price sources

### 2. Reactive Smart Contracts (Monitoring Layer)
- **PriceMonitorReactive.sol**: Monitors price feeds and triggers rebalancing
- **ThresholdChecker.sol**: Evaluates price changes against configured thresholds
- **RiskAnalyzer.sol**: Assesses portfolio risk and allocation health

### 3. Destination Contracts (Execution Layer)
- **TreasuryVault.sol**: Main treasury contract on each chain
- **Rebalancer.sol**: Executes swaps and cross-chain transfers
- **GovernanceGuard.sol**: Emergency controls and governance overrides

## Workflow

```
1. Price Change Event → Chainlink/Uniswap
2. PriceMonitorReactive detects change > threshold
3. Calculates optimal rebalancing strategy
4. Sends callbacks to destination chains
5. TreasuryVault executes rebalancing
6. Cross-chain bridges handle fund transfers
```

## Key Features

### Automated Triggers
- **Price-based**: ETH drops 10% → sell to USDC
- **Time-based**: Weekly rebalancing to target allocation
- **Risk-based**: Concentration risk → diversify holdings

### Cross-Chain Support
- **Ethereum**: Primary treasury + DeFi integrations
- **Arbitrum**: Lower gas execution layer
- **BSC**: Alternative DeFi opportunities

### Governance Integration
- **Multisig controls**: Emergency pause, parameter updates
- **DAO voting**: Strategy changes, new assets
- **Transparency**: All decisions on-chain and auditable

## Technical Benefits for Hackathon

### Heavy REACT Usage ✅
- Continuous price monitoring across multiple feeds
- Cross-chain message passing for rebalancing
- Multiple reactive contracts working in coordination

### Real DAO Adoption ✅
- Solves actual treasury management pain points
- Reduces manual intervention and human error
- Provides transparent, rules-based decisions

### Compelling Demo ✅
- Live price changes trigger visible rebalancing
- Multi-chain portfolio dashboard
- Real transactions on mainnet with REACT gas usage

## Implementation Priority

1. **MVP**: Single asset (ETH/USDC) on Ethereum
2. **V2**: Multi-asset portfolio management
3. **V3**: Full cross-chain deployment
4. **V4**: Advanced DeFi strategies (yield farming, etc.)
